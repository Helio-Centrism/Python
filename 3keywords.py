# Keywords in Python
# Keywords are the reserved words in Python. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier.They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

# In Python, keywords are case sensitive.
# There are 33 keywords in Python 3.7. This number can vary slightly in the course of time.
#for example: False, class, finally, is, return, None, continue, for, lambda, try, True, def, from, nonlocal, while, and, del, global, not, with, as, elif, if, or, yield, assert, else, import, pass, break, except, in, raise

# All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as it is. The list of all the keywords is given below.
# False      await      else       import     pass
# None       break      except     in         raise
# True       class      finally    is         return
# and        continue   for        lambda     try
# as         def        from       nonlocal   while
# assert     del        global     not        with
# async      elif       if         or         yield

# We cannot use keywords as variable names, function names or any other identifier. Here is an example to demonstrate this.
